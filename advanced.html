I use container addons to separate all of my browsing. Containers are basically what they sound like. It's a box that you can put e.g. facebook in and you can create another one for different sites. That means that the tracking cookies from your shopping does not affect your facebooking and vice versa.

I use two addons for this. One is called Firefox Multi-account Containers. With this you can create containers that always open when you go to any given site. I have facebook in a separate container, reddit in a separate container, all workrelated stuff in another and so on. These containers are persistent so I don't need to login every time. To add a site to a container, just open the container from the addon, go to the website you wish to add to it, click the icon in the browser and mark the checkbox “Always open in this container” and that's it. It will automatically open in that container from now on.

I also use the extension Temporary Containers for the rest. These containers are for weird searches and general browsing. These containers get thrashed when I close the tab and all the associated cookies with it.
